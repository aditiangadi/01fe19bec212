# PIPELINING

Pipelining technique is most followed technique in the digital design which involves breaking down of an sequential process into sub operations . The sub-blocks are then pushed into a series of hardware blocks to process it independent of the complete operation. 
this technique helps us to save the number of clock cycles which are used to display each instruction.
