# HALF ADDER

Half adder is a combinational  arithmetic circuit that adds two numbers and produces a sum bit (S) and carry bit (C) as the output. If  A and B are the input bits, then sum bit (S) is the X-OR of A and B  and the carry bit (C) will be the AND of A and B. From this it is clear that a half adder circuit can be easily constructed using one X-OR gate and one AND gate.From this it is clear that a half adder circuit can be easily constructed using one X-OR gate and one AND gate. This is written in verilog and simulated in Xilinx
