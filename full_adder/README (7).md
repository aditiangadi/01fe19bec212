# FULL ADDER

A full adder is a circuit that has two AND gates, two EX-OR gates, and one OR gate. The full adder adds three binary digits. Among all the three, one is the carry that we obtain from the previous addition as C-IN, and the two are inputs A and B. It designates the input carry as the C-OUT and the normal output as S (or SUM).
