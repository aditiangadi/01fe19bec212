# HALF ADDER
A half-adder shows how two bits can be added together with a few simple logic gates. In practice they are not often used because they are limited to two one-bit inputs.
The logic gates in half adder are exclusive OR gate and AND gate The Half adder will take two inputs Named as A, B then it will give two outputs named as Sum, Carry. Carry = A . B 
The result Sum is exclusive addition between A, B, then result Carry is AND logic operation between A, B.
